# Discord-Music-Bot
A simple discord music bot that was made using wavelink
To run the actual bot you need to allow Gateaway Intents for the bot to actually run
and make an env variable for Token and place your token there no need for "Token Here" and just type the token to the env variable like this Token Here
after all of that just run main.py and you are good to go
